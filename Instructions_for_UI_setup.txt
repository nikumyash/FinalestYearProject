### UI Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to add the return button and lesson name text to your game UI:

1. Open your Game scene where you already have a Canvas with the Timer and other UI elements.

2. Add a Return Button:
   - In the Hierarchy, right-click on your Canvas -> UI -> Button
   - Position it in the bottom left of the screen
   - Set the Button text to "Return to Menu"
   - Set the Button color to something that stands out but matches your UI theme
   - Adjust the size as needed (about 200x50 recommended)

3. Add a Lesson Name Text:
   - In the Hierarchy, right-click on your Canvas -> UI -> Text - TextMeshPro
   - Position it in the bottom right of the screen
   - Set the horizontal and vertical alignment to right and bottom respectively
   - Clear the default text (it will be set at runtime)
   - Set font size to match your other UI elements (around 24-28 recommended)
   - Set color to match your UI theme

4. Connect the UI elements to the UIManager:
   - Select your UIManager GameObject in the Hierarchy
   - In the Inspector, find the UIManager component
   - Connect the references:
     - Drag the new TextMeshPro text to the "Lesson Name Text" field
     - Drag the new Button to the "Return To Menu Button" field

5. Test the game:
   - Enter Play mode
   - The lesson name should appear in the bottom right
   - The return button should be clickable and return you to the main menu

That's it! The lesson name will update automatically when the lesson is loaded, and the return button will call the GameManager's ReturnToMainMenu method when clicked.
